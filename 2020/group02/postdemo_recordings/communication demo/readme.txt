Some extra info regarding the files
**********************************************

To provide some context as to how the files were recorded. We first recorded the voice message on a dictaphone application on a mobile device.
It was then played back in the vicinity of the BT-headset and the internal microphone (similar to the demo setting on friday).
For the first three recordings, the manual mixing slider was put all the way to device 1 (internal mic, recording 1), then to device 2 (BT headset, recording 2) and finally in the middle (mixed output, recording 3).
Because in the third recording, the mixed streams are not very distinguishable as they are aligned, we applied opposing pitch shifts to each device in two additional recordings (4 and 5).
This way, both devices are distinguishable while listening to the mixed output.

Sidenote : The BT headset sometimes sounds a bit crackly. This is due to poor quality of it's microphone and is not related to our application itself.
