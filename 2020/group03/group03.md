# SPAI-course-project-code
This is the folder including the code and audio files of group03 from the 2020 SPAI course project.

------------
Included executables:
- SPAI_Part1.exe: application for the first part of the project
- SPAI_Part1_WAV.exe: same but with WAV file exporting (buggy and very sensitive to some manipulations, not recommended!)
- SPAI_Part2.exe: application for the second part of the project
- SPAI_Part2_WAV.exe: same but with WAV file exporting (buggy and very sensitive to some manipulations, not recommended!)

Prerequisites:
- ASIO4ALL should be installed

Instructions:
- Run the executable
- Configure in- and outputs (must be 2 output channels and 4 input channels)
- Configure samplerate as wanted (note that the convolutional reverb works best with a sample rate of 11025Hz)
- Configure buffer size as low as possible without it causing glitches (depends on platform and hardware)
- Press 'Play' button to start processing audio, the input configuration will be checked and reported if necessary
- Have fun!

Support:
- Always happy to answer any questions regarding the applications, please drop a mail on jomi.verwimp(at)student.kuleuven.be!
