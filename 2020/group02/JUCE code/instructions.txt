Instructions Juce code
*************************************

The 'Source' folder contains all source files used in the juce projects. 
To simplify running the actual compiled code, we just included the executable in this folder. 
Should you want to build the source code, the best way would be to add them manually to a project within the projucer IDE, which will generate the VS project.
We also made some minor changes to the juce modules for aggregation functionality, these files are included in the 'module_modifications' folder.
