# SPAI-course-project-code
This is the folder including the code and audio files of group01 from the 2020 SPAI course project.

------------



Sadly,the final project is not successfully merged. So the the working code of each part of our project is uploaded. 
The RD.sln in the root dic is our structure, onces starts it which will start the three child process which are responsible to Aggregator, DSP and Transmitter. The program of these 3 process can be find in the dic of that name. In the aggregator standalone there is a jucer program which starts the program we demoed that day. In the DSP there are latency match and pitch shifting program. The transmitter can only transfer any type of data and to demo we set the data type to string. If the program was merged, it would transfer audio stream without any fault. The dual-communiciation is enabled by instantiating both sender and receiver objects in receiver app and sender app. The source code of the sender and receiver is upload in a seperate zip file.
