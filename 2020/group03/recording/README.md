- Recordings:
  - Part 1
    - group03_part1_in1_left and _right: internal microphone array of my Surface Pro before any processing
    - group03_part1_in2_left and _right: B&O Beoplay H7 headset microphone connected over Bluetooth
    - group03_part1_out1: stereo output of the application

  - Processing
    - WAV files were recorded as multi-channel files so they were split up using Cakewalk DAW software and exported back into WAV at 44kHz sample rate (original was 8kHz)
    - The output file seems to be corrupted in some way, importing into DAW is not possible. However it does play fine with VLC, so it is included as is.
    
  - Note
    - From these recordings we can conclude that the glitches and stutter that occured during the demo, were already present at the input before any processing. Presumably, this was caused by an external factor not related to any of the DSP implementations in our application.
